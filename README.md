Homework Week 1

How many objects will be created according to the following lines of code?

1. String s1="Welcome";  
2. String s2="Welcome";  
3. String s3="Welcome";




------------------
	1) Let's create a static and String data type variable. And let its value be <<code>>.
	2) Let's write a method whose return type is String and takes a String[] parameter. Have at least 5 different Strings in the incoming parameter. Let's check the condition whether it contains the value that we set as static in each element. 
	3) Let's take the parameters that we will send to the method in the Main method from the user as input with the Scanner. Find the String containing the static <<code>> string specified in the method, and return the found String from the method. (1 String will contain the value we specified) Console "String value containing the defined value: " + <<String_value_name>> "
  
Print it.
